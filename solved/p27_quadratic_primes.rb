# Find the product of the coefficients, aa and bb, for the quadratic
# expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive
# values of nn, starting with n=0n=0.
#
# Considering quadratics of the form:
#
# n^2+an+b, where |a|< 1000  and |b|â‰¤1000
#
# where |n||n| is the modulus/absolute value of n

# I found two ways to solve this, each with minor tradeoffs from each other
#   1.  Build a prime sieve big enough to have all possible numbers that
#       So you don't need to check every number you get.
#       This is less space effiencnt, but is faster even with the time it
#       takes to build the sieve in the first place
#
#   2.  Brute force check all of the numbers for their prime-ness
#       Doesn't use as much space, but is slower overall
